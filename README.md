#Final-Project

This is a Fantasy Football game.
Players will choose real football players to be on their team; one QB, two RB, two WR, one TE, one Kicker, and one Defense.
After that, each player will be responsible for inputing the stats for each of their players.
The sum of all the players on one team is taken.
The team with the highest score wins the game for the week!

Thanks to Mrs. Gerstien, Damon Artis, Julien Heurteux, and Arthur Golec for help in this game.
